## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week, a notable achievement was the successful implementation of our algorithm. It played a crucial role in our project, and we managed to put it to the test, which was a significant milestone.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

During this week, one of the prominent challenges we encountered was related to timing. We had a VTO event that required the attendance of the entire team, consuming a substantial portion of our available time.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We are making good progress towards completing our sprints for this week. As we prepare for next week's sprint, I propose breaking down the tasks into smaller ones. Typically, we all handle significant components, so dividing the workload can enhance efficiency and collaboration

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, we, as a team, found them to be beneficial. The stand-up meetings helped us maintain a good pace and stay focused on our tasks. Moreover, the Trello board proved to be quite helpful in organizing and managing our work efficiently.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

At the moment, I don't see any features at risk. However, there is one missing component for our project, which is the RateMyProfession API. We need to implement it, and I believe that will be our primary focus for the upcoming week. Additionally, we aim to work on displaying the calendar view for the schedules we create alongside implementing the API.
